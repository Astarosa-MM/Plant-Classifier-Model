# Plant Species Image Classifier

A deep learning image classification model that identifies plant species using transfer learning with MobileNetV2.

Being built as an independent research project at Louisiana State University, with an emphasis on Louisiana-native plant species.

## Overview

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant species from leaf and specimen images. 

The full ML pipeline includes:

- data collection & labeling
- preprocessing
- augmentation
- training & fine-tuning
- evaluation & visualization

Dataset Size: ~8,000+ images
Model so far achieves **~95% validation accuracy**.

## Features

- Transfer learning with MobileNetV2
- Data augmentation to address class imbalance
- Automated training + validation workflow
- Confusion matrix and classification metrics
- Google Colab compatible
- Modular and easy to extend for new classes

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab


## Motivation/Thesis

Manual plant identification is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project explores how computer vision can assist biological research by automating species classification and improving dataset organization.
